This project presents a machine learning-based solution for detecting online payment fraud. A classification model was trained on a labeled dataset of transactional data to identify patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior. The trained model, saved as a pickle file, is integrated into a Flask web application. Users can enter transaction details via a user-friendly web interface, and the model returns a prediction indicating whether the transaction is likely fraudulent. The system demonstrates the end-to-end deployment of a machine learning model, from training to real-time inference through a web-based interface.
